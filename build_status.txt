Notes:
- To flash the board, ensure `nrfjprog` is installed on host and the board is connected.
- Example flash commands:
  nrfjprog -f nrf52 --eraseall
  nrfjprog -f nrf52 --program experiments/security/before_patching/build/nrf52840_xxaa.hex --verify
  nrfjprog -f nrf52 --reset

- If you want me to run the host-side flash and smoke test, tell me and I will do it (I need permission to run `nrfjprog` on your machine and the board must be connected).
